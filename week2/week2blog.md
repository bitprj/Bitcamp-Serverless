## **Week 2**

Last week, you should've learned the basics of how to create an Azure Function, along with the basics of triggers and bindings.

### **Learning Objectives**

- retrieving data from Face API
- making HTTP requests using fetch
- installing and using npm dependencies

### **Livestream**

In the livestream, we're going to code a HTTP trigger Azure Function that detects facial hair in a submitted picture.

- For the full video, look in the [video folder](https://github.com/emsesc/bitcamp-serverless/blob/master/week2/livestream/videos).
- For the full code, look in the [code folder](https://github.com/emsesc/bitcamp-serverless/blob/master/week2/livestream/code).

We'll be going over how to:

1. configure npm dependencies in Functions
2. parse multipart form data
3. create a Face API resource
4. make a HTTP request to the Face API
5. test the function using Postman

## Review: Creating the HTTP Trigger

Like last week, we'll be creating

## Installing Dependencies

## Parse Multipart

## The Face API

## Using Fetch to Make a Request

## Testing: Postman
