# Bitcamp-Serverless
## **Week 2**

Last week, you should've learned the basics of how to create an Azure Function, along with the basics of triggers and bindings.

### **Learning Objectives**

- retrieving data from Face API
- making HTTP requests using fetch
- installing and using npm dependencies

### **Livestream**

In the livestream, we're going to code a HTTP trigger Azure Function that detects facial hair in a submitted picture.

- For the full video, look in the [video folder](https://github.com/emsesc/bitcamp-serverless/blob/master/week2/livestream/videos).
- For the full code, look in the [code folder](https://github.com/emsesc/bitcamp-serverless/blob/master/week2/livestream/code).

**We'll be going over how to:**

1. configure npm dependencies in Functions
2. parse multipart form data
3. create a Face API resource
4. make a HTTP request to the Face API
5. test the function using Postman

### Homework
Create a HTTP trigger Azure Function that uses the Face API to analyze emotion in a picture. 
- The step by step runthrough is located in the [issues folder](homework/issues). Follow the issues numerically to complete the project. 
- Any starter and solution code is in the [code folder](homework/code) in homework.
